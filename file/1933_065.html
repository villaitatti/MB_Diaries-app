		<p>Logan, Ernesta Barlow<p>
		<p>Lovely day<p>
		<p>Anthony and Johnny Waterfield came to lunch, Kristeller to see B.B. (first Maria Teresa Rasponi to walk w. him) and Mrs. Shapley and her 2 little daughters to see me and pick flowers in the garden. Left and went to bed with a return of fever. Klemperer came to call, to borrow ₤ 1000 lire, poor man.<p>

		<p>Rain<p>
		<p>Karin telephoned that their car had broken down at Borgo San Sepolcro, hence can’t return by tomorrow. Alone for lunch. Pellegrina called. I want to town. Ernesta Barlow came to stay for 2 nights. Logan in bed with fever. Perhaps malaria?<p>

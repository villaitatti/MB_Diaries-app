		<p>Friday, October 22, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  The Travers-Borgström came to tea. She does fuss. BB dined with Sybil.   </p>
		<p>I have given up hope about Cecil. His character is too weak for his talents to prosper. All these years I have hoped and excused or hoped, but something has snapped.  BB is also unhopeful for his future and I think Geoffrey is also. Such a pity, for he has genius.</p>
		<p>  Ray has a choice of and wants Friday’s Hill Cottage, where she spent her childhood. I’ve had to advise her against it, as we none of us know what the war may do to our money. She is busy getting women to work on munitions.</p>

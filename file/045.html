		<p>Friday, January 22, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  I cursed today when the Marainis telephoned to ask if they could come up and look at the Art Magazines, for I do so love my quiet days.</p>
		<p>However, I made an excuse of Mrs. Ross and got a long walk alone in the woods, which I truly love.  And Yoï wasn’t so bad. She’s been less gênante ever since Stan repeated to her some of the severe things I said. She sees I don’t “understand,” so she bothers me less.</p>
		<p>  Later I called on poor Mrs. Ross, who has fallen into a sad apathy. She sits all day by the fire, only stirring to make it up, and shuddering and wincing from time to time as if someone struck her.</p>
		<p>   B.B. went up to Sybil’s as usual.</p>
		<p>She does talk – unceasingly.</p>

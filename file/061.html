		<p>Sunday, February 7, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Naima, Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Did absolutely nothing but read and work all day.</p>
		<p>Cecil cleared up lots of household things, the angel, and then went to tea with Sybil, while BB (for a change) called on the Strongs. Geoffrey was awfully depressed, but got better after a walk all by himself. I couldn’t go, as my cold was heavy on me. </p>

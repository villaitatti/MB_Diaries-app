		<p>Motored over after lunch (Benn) and saw the town. BB and Sybil came in her car, but were late, having been to San Gimignano. Sybil reduced us all to complete silence by a flood of dull sub-comic self-absorbed talk. It was really horrible, and we decided to fly away and leave BB to bear it. As he is in the silly shape of infatuation he probably likes it. I think she is a nice person behind all this appalling rubbish, but I wish he would some time choose an amie whom one didn’t have to explore in the subterranean depths to like. However, this is a vast improvement in the grating vulgarity of Belle Greene!!</p>

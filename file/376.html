		<p>Sunday, December 19, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rainy and clearing</p>
		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  A quiet day, spent mostly in correcting BB’s manuscript. This time he has surpassed himself in bad writing!</p>
		<p>  BB and Naima went for a walk, and I called on Lina and Aunt Janet. Lucien and his wife called. He goes back to Udine tomorrow.</p>
		<p>  Marcella took tea and dined with Geoffrey. She is a very unconventional creature and does just what she feels like doing. But I think she is a nice creature, too. </p>

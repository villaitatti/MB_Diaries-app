		<p>Friday, October 13, 1933, I Tatti<p>
		<p>Katkoft<p>
		<p>Pour in morning<p>
		<p>Miss McLaren (22) from the Courtauld Institute came to lunch. B.B. liked her.<p>
		<p>She took Katkoff to call on Strong. Giglioli put in a drainage tube, but it did not stay. Felt very ill.<p>
		<p>Saturday, October 14, 1933, I Tatti<p>
		<p>Perfect October day<p>
		<p>Kept in the tube longer. Felt unusually jolly, but got worn out by an hour with Leo Stein, who came to tell me his criticisms on my “Glossary” and talked all the time of himself! It would be interesting if he weren’t so slow! Cecil Anrep and Professor Russo came to lunch. Long walk with B.B.<p>

		<p>I don’t know the weather. I lay “sotto voce like a toad under the harrow” all day. B.B. was in bed too. Elizabeth called on a pair of Dalderzier.<p>

		<p>Edith Wharton<p>
		<p>Grey<p>
		<p>The Gronitch couple came to lunch and I went to the Library to see them. She is a devasting snob, talked only of Balearic royaltees.<p>
		<p>Edith Wharton arrived after tea from Paris. How little interested she is in the talk of others even in B.B.’s talk!<p>

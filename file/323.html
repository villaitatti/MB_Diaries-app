		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey still liver-y, poor thing.</p>
		<p>I am sending garments to soldiers at the front, so many touching appeals. Alas.</p>
		<p>  Bernard and I walked over old Careggi mound, over the pine-hill. It is being enclosed as hospital ground. We have walked there for 25 years. </p>
		<p>  Called on Bassianos. She suffered so she says she’ll never have another baby.</p>
		<p>This one is a great beauty already, although only 4 days old.</p>

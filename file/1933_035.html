		<p>Friday, February 17, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Naima</p>
		<p>I actually drove out today – only as far as Naima’s near (?) home on the Poggio Gherardo estate, still it was a beginning.</p>
		<p>In the evening I began to read to B.B. Childs’ Across Asia Minor on Foot</p>
		<p>Saturday, February 18, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Cecil, Naima</p>
		<p>Castelmaurigi and Jim Flexner came to lunch, the latter walked with B.B. and I drove to the top of the hill.</p>
		<p>Cecil came to dine and shared us his enchanting design for Fummi’s house at Rome</p>

		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott, Naomi </p>
		<p> Rain</p>
		<p>  Cecil said he would stay to finish our work. Four months gained to his life. Perhaps the War will be over – but I am afraid not, although BB is sure it will.</p>
		<p>Naima feels rather more at her ease now, and her hoydenish, stupid flirtatiousness is getting on my nerves. It is such bad form. There is nothing else on earth she takes the slightest interest in, except her illnesses, and, I must add, her little niece in Sweden. She reduces us to about the level of a servant’s hall. I cannot blame the men for following her lead, for there is really absolutely nothing else to do with her. If she were belle et spirituelle I think I should even like it. But her gambols are uncouth—her hand is heavy and I really got sick of it.</p>
		<p>  Walked in woods with Geoffrey. </p>

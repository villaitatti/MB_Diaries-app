		<p>Thursday, February 11, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Went with Geoffrey and Byba Giuliani to Donizetti’s opera “Elisir d'amore” but had to leave before it ended, as I went to the American Consul’s reception–a dull affair. The music was charming and Burci sang well. </p>
		<p>  Salvemini came to dine. He said he had not read the papers for 2 weeks, while he was working at Balsorano, and he was tremendously struck with the change of tone. </p>

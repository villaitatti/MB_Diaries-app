		<p>Tuesday, March 2, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Perfect</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey has influenza, and Cecil came up to spend the night, instead of Geoffrey’s going down there.</p>
		<p>Had a lovely walk alone, which I prefer to anybody’s company almost–in fact, quite. It is the only way to escape into nature.</p>
		<p>  BB had a motor drive in the Mugello with Sybil. </p>

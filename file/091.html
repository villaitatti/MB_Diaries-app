		<p>Tuesday, March 9, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Cold</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Placci came to lunch, and afterwards Sybil and Carlo Visconti Venosta came for a Santa [sic.] Conversazione (on the War of course) which lasted until 5:30. We get more and more the feeling that Italy isn’t going in, in spite of Carlo’s knowing it. The papers are changing, too. Von Bülow is persuading them they can get something for nothing.</p>
		<p>  BB dined with Sybil. </p>

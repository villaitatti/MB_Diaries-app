		<p>Elizabeth went off on a holiday by the sea with Cosimo Paolucci’s his nurse. Argia came up for me. A cousin of Johnny’s, Severance and his friend Caesar came up to lunch. Severance recalled Johnny in charm intelligence and looks. Hortense came to tea and went on reading her journal. She does write very well.<p>

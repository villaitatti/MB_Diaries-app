		<p>Alys Pellegrina A. Green</p>
		<p>Lovely</p>
		<p>Morra went to Rome. We drove to the Secchietta and had walks. I got very tired. Great buzz about Judith’s coming, but finally settled. Then waiting for Karin – who oh joy is coming!!</p>

		<p>Fine</p>
		<p>Quiet day. Green is like an unwieldy water-buffalo, chewing over and over again the same curd – his negro wife, his boy with the doubtful fortune, his grievances and Dominica.</p>

		<p>Thursday, February 18, 1916, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Mr. and Mrs. Dumont brought the ineffable Mrs Tryphosa Bates Batcheller (and Mr.) to call. BB ran away with Sybil after ½ hour but I had them there for 3 hours. Cecil came in and helped. “Tryphosa” is a Worcester, Massachusetts girl who has pushed her way, being pretty and snobbish, into Austrian and Italian society and written indescribably silly books. Geoffrey reviewed one once in the Manchester Guardian.   </p>
		<p>  Placci came to dine. This time we absolutely are going to war, “early in April.”</p>

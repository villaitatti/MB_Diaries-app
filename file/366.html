		<p>Thursday, December 9, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Scirocco</p>
		<p>Mrs. Baldwin</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> Still in bed with influenza. Mrs. Baldwin arrived at 2, but left her dress-suit case behind her in the train. The Dumonts and Marainis came to dine, while Geoffrey went to dine with Sybil.</p>
		<p>BB took Sybil a drive, and the machine got stuck in the mud and had to be hauled out by contadini. </p>
		<p>  Ammannati came and cast great woe into my soul by saying the cook’s books were an average of 86 francs a day–quite monstrous.</p>

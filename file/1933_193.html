		<p>Monday, December 25, 1933, I Tatti<p>
		<p>A quiet grey damp Christmas. B.B. and I enjoyed being together. We finished the Stratforde de Redcliffe biography.<p>
		<p>Margaret Strong Kinta and her husband called.<p>
		<p>Tuesday, December 26, 1933, I Tatti<p>
		<p>Rain mist<p>
		<p>Ojetti came to lunch, but I did not get up. We had a dinner party for Kinta and Jack, 2 Anreps, 3 Waterfields â€“ 12 altogether. It went off well enough.<p>
		<p>But since my illness I feel as if people in company were talking and laughing as meaningless as birds twittering.<p>

		<p>Wednesday, May 26, 1915, Hotel Brufani Perugia</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Went to Fossombrone and were shut up as German spies, until the Commanding officer got too hungry to wait any longer for his collazione [sic].</p>
		<p>Strange sensation to be gazed at by myriads of hard, unfriendly eyes. The people are quite off their heads with excitement, and would have loved to lynch us!</p>
		<p>Sybil’s letter from the Marchese Imperiali, Ambassador in Rome, was the only thing that counted.</p>
		<p>Our passports were nothing. </p>
		<p>Came on to Perugia, rather disgusted. </p>

		<p>Thursday, March 4, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Had to go to town, which I really hate doing now. Called on Yoï who is still very sick and miserable. A horrible hour with the dressmaker and then called on the Strongs, and saw their new building. I like Margaret. Called on Sybil, with whom BB had been dining all afternoon.</p>
		<p>   I get horribly fussed when I have too much to do, such as calls and things in town. I hate it and love the quiet life here walking in the woods and seeing almost no one. </p>

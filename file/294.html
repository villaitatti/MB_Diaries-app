		<p>Tuesday, September 28, 1915, Caprarola</p>
		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Motored to Soriano, Bomarzo and Vignanello. Bomarzo has a Park filled with great rocks and boulders carved into giants and dragons, elephants etc., more like a deserted Eastern shrine (Chinese) than anything I ever saw in Europe.</p>
		<p>  Mrs. Baldwin recounted to me the whole Gladys-Marlborough epic, how they were devoted to each other through 14 years of trial, and how those “dirty hounds” the “Yanks,” i.e., the Duchess’ Mother and friends put the blame on angel-innocent Gladys.</p>
		<p>  They quarreled like maniacs, till once, quarreling about Titian, Gladys bit his hand, and he thrashed her nose till it cracked, and she has been an angel ever since!</p>

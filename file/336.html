		<p>Tuesday, November 9, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>  Began work on North Italians–such fun.</p>
		<p>Sybil came, and this time talked of Art and other non-war themes. BB had told her he simply couldn’t bear it when his friend turned into public institutions or philanthropical [sic] committees. </p>
		<p>  I called on poor asthmatic Miss Paterson and then on poor bronchial-pleurisy-enteritis Miss Preistley, an infinitely nicer creature.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey had Marcella Michela to tea. </p>

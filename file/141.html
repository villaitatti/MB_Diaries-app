		<p>Wednesday, April 28, 1915, Hotel Brufani Perugia</p>
		<p>Fine, Rain</p>

		<p>I went with Cecil and Geoffrey to Chiusi and Sarteano to look for sponge-stone. A most lovely country. Left Cecil at Cortona to return. The Lake of Thrasymenus under a storm was so beautiful that we could hardly believe we really saw it. </p>

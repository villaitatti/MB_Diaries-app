		<p>Wednesday, November 3, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  BB and I had a violent discussion about money, and I spent the rest of the day trying to see just how it all stands. I am inclined to feel that everything is always my fault.</p>
		<p>I   took Mrs. Ross to lunch with the Dumonts, not a great treat for any of us, I fear.</p>
		<p>I had a little walk with Geoffrey and Bernard, and this was a treat, for me, at any rate. They both seem well.</p>
		<p>  Sybil and Irene and Cecil and Carlo and Ady Placci came to dine–a thoroughly boring evening. I am paralyzed as a hostess by Sybil, who talks in a loud voice, very vehemently, and distracts everyone.</p>
		<p>She is a Bore!!</p>

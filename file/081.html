		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>

		<p>  Woke still rheumatic. Giglioli advised taking atophan. It was glorious walking, such spring sunshine, daffodils and anemoni and narcissus out, and pussy-willows all grey by the streams. But Geoffrey was very gloomy and seemed to spread a blackness over the sky, which I could only just manage to pierce here and there. I wanted awfully to walk off by myself and really enjoy all the loveliness. He was only cross because Sybil was all in a turmoil about his worries of Cecil enlisting, and Lady Enniskillen having reported her as “working to that end” some ten days ago. I was silly to have repeated this to BB as I might have known the coil it would cause. Well, I might have repeated much worse!!</p>

		<p>Monday, April 19, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Am writing an article on Bicci di Lorenzo which amuses me. Sirén, Giglioli, Venturi, Poggi, Carotti, and Toesca have all worked him up, getting together a list of about 35 pictures, and I find 29 more in our notes that they’ve never heard of. It is the same with every painter I think. I am glad to constate it for it shows we work well and are fairly competent.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey and I called on Lady Enniskillen and Madame von Heiroth and BB spent the afternoon with Sybil. </p>

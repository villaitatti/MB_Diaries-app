		<p>  Bad rheumatism, but had a long walk with Geoffrey, very delightful in the new wealth of sunshine and blue hills. We called on the Priest at Vincigliata, a nice cultivated little person, fond of music and languages. Walked 3 hours–it was so enchanting.</p>
		<p>  BB had a motor ride with Sybil. </p>

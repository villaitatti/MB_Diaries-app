		<p>Monday, April 26, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Hot and sultry</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Geoffrey awfully depressed. It seems to me really pathological. It is pitiful, and yet so depressing to me as almost to get on my nerves, but I try my best not to let it. I feel so awfully sorry for him. It is all burned up with Yoï, who came to dine, along with Dott. De Nicola. Geoffrey fled her and dined with Sybil, spending the night there.</p>
		<p>  I went to town with Lina and saw Horne’s new Palazzo which he has restored in Quattrocento style. Mascha von Heiroth (now de Heiroth) and Lina helped me get more hats. Yoï is scared to death about her approaching confinement. </p>

		<p>Sunday, October 24, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Naima</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  The Blackes have lost their second son, on the French Front. Poor people.</p>
		<p>We are all terribly low about the war, with these Balkan complications. It is too miserable to talk about.  </p>
		<p>  BB and Naima motored up Monte Morello, and Geoffrey and I walked in the garden borders waiting for Lady Enniskillen, who came very late. She, too, is depressed and anxious.</p>

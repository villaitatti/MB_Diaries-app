		<p>Sunday, November 7, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  A perfectly heavenly day–real St. Martin’s summer.</p>
		<p>Grappled very unsuccessfully with accounts this morning. With several false alarms and mistakes. I must get Geoffrey to help me.</p>
		<p>  We all far motored up to Monte Senario in the afternoon and walked along that delicious meadow on the ridge looking down into the Val di Mugello. There I called on Mrs. Ross and Lina. Found Aunt      Janet very depressed on England’s muddle</p>

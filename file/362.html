		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p>Dull</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey in bed. Miss Cohen came to lunch. Walked down from “the Grove”. </p>
		<p>Wrote to Ray, Alban, Spragues, Sally Harlan, Alys.</p>
		<p>  Got very angry with the men servants for their inability to organize the service of Geoffrey’s meals in his room. They are really awfully stupid, but I suppose they can’t help it.</p>
		<p>I am led to believe that getting angry is the only way to impress Italian servants, but it is very degrading for one’s self.</p>

		<p>Saturday, November 20, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p>Wind</p>

		<p>  Called for Mrs. Ross and Miss Hunter and went to the Red Cross Entertainment at Villa Medici. The lights went out for nearly all the time, but at the end Iris’ Play “The Slippers of the Princess” got its lighting. It was very pretty, and all ended well. We felt pretty tired just from seeing, and Cecil who did it all looked a ghost.</p>
		<p>  Guido went at 11:30. We had a long talk. He said he was awfully anxious and distressed about Italy’s policy, feared a secret and disgraceful treaty with Germany, etc. </p>
		<p>  Yoï was there and rather played off Nello and Geoffrey, making them both uncomfortable, and Geoffrey acutely miserable and sea-sick.</p>

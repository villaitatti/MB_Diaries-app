		<p>Saturday, October 30, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p>  Got up at noon. Feel better. Bernard went over to see Sybil. Naima came. She says Aristea boasts in the market of having made 30000 francs out of us.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey dined and slept at Villa Medici.</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>I made myself very miserable reading over some old letters of 1895. I’m so afraid I am the same person still, and I feel rather muddled about things. BB comes out very well from these letters–I horrible.</p>

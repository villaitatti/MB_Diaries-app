		<p>Saturday, January 23, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Naima</p>
		<p>  Worked. Took Nelly Erichsen to town for her errands, while I called on Herbert Horne, who now has sciatica as well as all the rest of his ailments.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey wrote they were going to Balzorano [sic] to distribute the old clothes they had bought in the ghetto. The poor people won’t use nice things, they save them to sell and meantime freeze to death.</p>
		<p>   Brought up Naima, who is nice but hideously devoid of conversation and interests. It is hard to know how to amuse her. In fact, one can’t, for she cares chiefly for flirting!   </p>

		<p>Sunday, March 19, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Logan and Desmond</p>
		<p>Desmond and B.B. and Nicky went to hear Klemperer conduct. They said it was marvellous!</p>
		<p>He came back to dine also the Anreps, and gave us his Cantata on David and Bathsheba</p>
		<p>He thumped on the piano and roared, but one felt it was great.</p>
		<p>Monday, March 20, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rainy</p>
		<p>Stayed in all day.</p>
		<p>Desmond and Nicky went to the Huntermann concert and I read Lawrence’s The Man who loved Islands to Logan and B.B. We thought it on the whole poor.</p>
		<p>Nicodemi came to lunch. He says D’Annunzio is at the height of his intellectual power!</p>

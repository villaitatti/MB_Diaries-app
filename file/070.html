		<p>  Didn’t want to go down to Placci’s to tea, but enjoyed ourselves when we went. Liked Lucien Henraux’s wife, who has come home as she could no longer follow Lucien. She doesn’t know where he is now. Salvemini and the Marchesa Benzoni were there, the latter sure, through her father, the Cabinet Minister Martini, that Italy is going to war. </p>

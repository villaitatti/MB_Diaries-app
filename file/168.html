		<p>Tuesday, May 25, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Urbino Albergo d’Italia</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Our motoring trip with BB and Sybil in her car driven by Parry, with Sybil’s maid, Lenty, and Geoffrey and I in our car driven by Cecil, with my maid Eliza. Got off about 11, lunched above Rignano, passed through Borgo Sansepolcro in a terrible rain, and got on to Urbino to find it full of refugees from Ancona, scared by the bombardment. </p>
		<p>  Great trouble to get rooms. </p>

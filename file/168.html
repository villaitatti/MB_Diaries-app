		<p>Sunday, November 5, 1933, I Tatti<p>
		<p>Mrs. Ellis<p>
		<p>Horrible, rainy<p>
		<p>Mr. and Mrs. James from the Victoria and Albert Museum came to lunch and stayed to tea. Nice young people. Betsy Ellis talked â€“ she is a jokey, well-meaning, vital creature!<p>

		<p>Mrs. Ellis<p>
		<p>Fine, warm<p>
		<p>Aubrey to lunch, took Betsey Ellis to Poggio. I called on Strong and Margaret Cuevas and saw the little dago children with shoe-button eyes. Then picked up B.B. at Villa Medici. The money question is getting serious!<p>

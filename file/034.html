		<p>Monday, January 11, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey staying</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Miss Priestly went after lunch. Geoffrey had a cold and went to bed. I took Flora down and did errands and went to the dressmaker:</p>
		<p>Although everyone is in distress, complaining of lack of work, I have found only one who finishes the work you give them in reasonable time. That is my old maid, Luisa.</p>
		<p>I engaged a new cameriere.</p>
		<p>  Nello, Yoï and Mr. and Mrs. Nelson Gay came to dine. Yoï looked awfully bored at the general talk, and contributed only the remark that Mrs. Ugo Ojetti had got very fat. Afterwards she told me she was the most sensitive and “pensive” person I had ever seen, she always felt and “intuited” what others were feeling and thinking. Had she known what a fool I thought her, she wouldn’t have gone on! She said Nello was frightfully jealous, and suspicious and wouldn’t let her go out alone. I said I thought he was quite right.</p>

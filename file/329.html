		<p>  Went to Hospital in Villa Pisa and saw “our” radioscope and the bullet in a man’s arm by means of it. Saw a picture Pavletti has to sell, which is really a very good Ambrogio Lorenzetti–a great temptation!   </p>
		<p>  The Gravina came to dine, and was nice till towards the end when she said that Germany had been attacked and the war and its present length was all England’s fault, and if Europe were militarized certainly Germany couldn’t be blamed etc. – I suppose she has to think all this.</p>
		<p>  Got the Roselminis into the villino, poor feckless things. </p>

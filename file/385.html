		<p>Tuesday, December 28, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>3 lunch 4 dinner</p>
		<p>  Julia went to stay a couple of days with Iris. </p>
		<p>  Sybil came over to have a walk with BB and later Lady Limerick and her son and daughter came to tea. I went to town and called on Miss Cochrane and Herbert Horne, and stopped at Geoffrey’s to pick him up: but Byba Guiliani was there and took no hint to leave, so I came away at 7, and Cecil brought him back later in Sybil’s little car. Byba is evidently in love with him, poor little thing–little suspecting what her friend has done in her absence. Both these girls behave as no well brought up English or even American girls could behave. Their talk about wanting emancipation to “become themselves” is amusing–it simply means to be free to run after young men. That is very natural, too, but their language is a travesty in the facts. </p>

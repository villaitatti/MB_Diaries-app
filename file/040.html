		<p>Sunday, January 17, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p> Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott, Naima</p>
		<p>  Work in morning. In the afternoon B.B, and Naima had a drive to Monte Senario and Geoffrey and I called on Sybil and the Strongs, and walked back. Cecil called on Aunt Janet. B.B. got awfully cross, but I can see that he is anything but well. </p>
		<p>  Aunt Janet is terribly broken by Frank Crisp’s death.</p>
		<p>   We sent £ 500 and clothes to the Terremoto Committee.</p>
		<p>  Cecil got up at 9 quite restored from his savage feast.</p>

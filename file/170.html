		<p>Morra<p>
		<p>Grey and rainy<p>
		<p>Professor Russo, a Sicilian professor of literature, came to lunch. B.B. and Nicky called on Strong, and I had Vernon Lee and Stein, to try his “Sonotone.” I did not keep her hearing, and it was a tragic-comedy with those two deaf people poor things. Went on with B.B’s Life.<p>

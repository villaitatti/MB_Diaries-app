		<p>Thursday, May 27, 1915, Hotel Brufani Perugia</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p> Sybil laid up all day. We motored to Mongiovino to see the Church and tried to see the frescoes at Panicale but the man was away with the key in his pocket.</p>
		<p>  Rather uncomfortable talk with the Loesers. She is pro-German of course. He pretends to be neutral. BB was too violent. </p>

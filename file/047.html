		<p>Sunday, January 24, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Naima</p>
		<p>  Mr. Strong and Margaret came to lunch. B.B. was ill, Naima silent, Strong deaf and Margaret bored. I felt desperate.</p>
		<p>Later B.B. and I called on Aunt Janet and met Ashburner there. Quiet evening of work. I am putting our scattered notes of the “minor” painters in order.</p>
		<p>  We decided to join Guido Cagnola in editing (a rather purging form) the “Rassegna d’Arte.”</p>

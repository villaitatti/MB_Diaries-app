		<p>Tuesday, October 19, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  At last tackled my little writing room and emptied and arranged the drawers of letters and papers. I found that card of Donnino's whose loss (ie careful putting away!) caused such well-deserved fury.</p>
		<p>  In the afternoon, while BB called on Sybil, who was ill in bed, I took our old “rampart walk,” around the hill to Fiesole, and enjoyed it immensely. There we called on the Bassianos.</p>
		<p>  Coming back we heard the bad news of our little Henri’s death–the very best servant there ever was, and one of the nicest men. We both feel it very much, and so do all those who knew him. </p>
		<p>What a brutal, crazy, tragic, meaningless war.</p>

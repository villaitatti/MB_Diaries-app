		<p>Tuesday, February 23, 1915</p>
		<p>Rain</p>

		<p>  Miss Priestly came to lunch rather depressed, but keeping a gay exterior. She has a delightful quality of lady likeness.</p>
		<p>I went to see Aunt Janet, who is certainly very changed by young Crisp’s death.</p>
		<p>Sybil called here while I was out, and had a long talk with Geoffrey, which upset his conscience and made him feel maybe he had thwarted the bent of Cecil’s real nature, in presenting the arguments for his staying to finish one job. Of course Cecil is free–but not really, for his nature is so weak he cannot resist pressure. Poor Geoffrey was trying to “see straight,” and got himself all tied up in scruples and difficulties.</p>
		<p>Afterwards BB said Sybil had been greatly influenced by her talk with Geoffrey!!</p>

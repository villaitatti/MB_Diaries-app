		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>  Called on Yoi and Princess Bassiano (both expecting babies very shortly) and Mrs. Ross.</p>
		<p>Heard that our old friend Alfred Benn died in Switzerland on the 16th. He lay down on the sofa in the morning of the 10th, having been apparently very well all summer, and became suddenly unconscious and never recovered. A blood vessel broke in his brain.</p>
		<p>What a lovely way to die.Â </p>

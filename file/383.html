		<p>Sunday, December 26, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>4 lunch, 5 dinner</p>
		<p>Julia, Naima Lofroth, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Fairish warm</p>
		<p>  Naima lunched with Mrs. Ross. Julia and Gordon explored the laghetto. Geoffrey and I talked ourselves deaf and blind. But it all perfectly clear to me, and I see him walking into a very perilous trap, and sophisticating himself (and sometimes me) into thinking “I’m sure that's not a hook.”</p>
		<p>However young people must try their experiments however dangerous. </p>
		<p>  BB had a walk with Naima, and I with Geoffrey. </p>

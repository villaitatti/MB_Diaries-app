		<p>Thursday, November 4, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Rain in the morning, but Bernard and I had a good walk in the afternoon, visiting that incredible deserted quarry all filled with flaming red leaves, just that one spot on the hillside, as if it were a faerie’s land where they had lighted inextinguishable torches.</p>
		<p>  BB dined with Cecil, who had had a letter from Percy Lubbock saying that while he was in the office of the Foreign Edition of the “Times”, the Dutch Ambassador came in great haste and importance to ask what line the “Times” would take if Germany proposed Peace on the basis of the status quo ante. This is connected with Bïslow’s visit (Switzerland brings some hope).</p>

		<p>Friday, November 5, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Raining nearly all day. I went out at 1:30 and dressmaked and shopped till 6. Horrible.</p>
		<p>Sybil came to see BB and they had a walk.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey dined with Sybil.</p>
		<p>Advised Ray and Karin to invest their 1000 from Aunty Lill’s estate through Bontbright in New York.</p>
		<p>  BB had a letter from Miss Greene after 3 months silence–a very ordinary sort of letter chiefly about money and deals, she explains her long silence by depression. Probably she is lying.</p>

		<p>Saturday, April 1, 1933, I Tatti<p>
		<p>Guido, Logan<p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky in Rome<p>
		<p>Guido Cagnola arrived at 7 and De Filippi came to dine. Said the Quangle Wangle Quee on the top of the Crumpetty Tree “when all these creatures move about what a wonderful noise there’ll be”<p>
		<p>Only 2 Italians but the noise was more wonderful.<p>

		<p>The Fletchers came at 3 bringing a Mrs. Huntington and her son. Some after came Kingsley Porter’s sister in law – a flabby but vivacious edition of Lucy Porter with her son and daughter and then Mrs. Hammer to say goodbye. I’d rather died<p>

		<p>Sunday, January 10, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain and mist here Fine at Fiesole</p>
		<p>Flora Priestley, Geoffrey, Cecil</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Had a telegram from Edward Hutton to say Frank Crisp was killed in action on the 5th, and now I must tell Mrs. Ross. So I did. It was really heartbreaking.  What grisly fantastic nonsense it is, tragic too. To think that human beings can find no way of settling their commerce and politics than killing all their young men.</p>
		<p>  Margaret Strong and Miss Paterson came to lunch, and afterwards I went up to see Lady Sybil, and walked back with Flora, stopping in to see Aunt Janet on the way.</p>

		<p>Friday, December 10, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Mrs. Baldwin, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>Scirocco</p>

		<p>  I got up to lunch, but felt very very giù and went to bed after.</p>
		<p>Examined myself the cook’s account–Ammannati must have been bewitched! They came to 70 a day. That is too much for 9 servants and an average of four people at a table, but still not so monstrous as 86! What could have happened?</p>
		<p>  Madame Henraux came to dine, a really charming person, so poised and simple and sane and healthy.</p>
		<p>Mrs. Baldwin’s talk is something horrible. She has abandoned all pretence at moralities and is absolutely cynical. BB is afraid to ask Sybil here to meet her. He thinks she w[ould] faint away.</p>

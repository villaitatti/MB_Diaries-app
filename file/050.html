		<p>Wednesday, January 27, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey</p>
		<p>Solid Rain</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Went on with my article. Suddenly Geoffrey appeared, full of interesting talk about the Earthquake zone. It was too rainy to go out, but Mr. Benn came to lunch.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey reported the Florentine Committee as too rotten and silly for words. The only man who is doing anything is Salvemini; and he is a little too doctrinaire for the situation, for he wants to build a sanitary new town in the plain, and thinks the peasants will desert their tumbled down hovels to live in it, whereas they probably won’t.  Cecil is helping him put up his skeleton town. </p>

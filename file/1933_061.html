		<p>Sir Augustus Daniel of the National Gallery came to lunch w. his friend, Sargent. They nearly killed B.B. by staying till 4.30. I crawled to bed feeling horrible and found I had 38º of fever. Mario Praz and Benedetto came to tea, and Adrian arrived at 7.30!</p>

		<p>Fine and then dandy</p>
		<p>In bed all day with 38.3º of fever – it makes one feel wretched. But Karin and Adrian are enjoying themselves in their little car. The Kantorowicz came to lunch, reported horrors from Germany. Johnny Waterfield came too. B.B. and Nicky called on the Davidssohns and Flora Priestley.</p>

		<p>Sunday, November 28, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Naima Lofroth</p>

		<p>  Such a heavenly day–but Ray says she can’t let Barbara come out, and all was black, until we got out on that wonderful Madonna del Sasso walk, BB and Naima and I.</p>
		<p>  When we came in, Prince Paul of Serbia, Nello and the weird-looking, tiger-eyed Marchesa Casati were here. They stayed a long time.</p>
		<p>  The Consul and his wife came to lunch. They say Loeser without a passport may have to go back to America, as the US wishes to have no German-Americans living abroad at this moment, and it is making it very awkward for them. </p>

		<p>  The boys went round the grounds and buildings. I went to town at 2:30 and had a most horrid session of dressmaking, or (worse still) dress correcting. Called on Mrs. Dumont and Mr. Batcheler who said the Germans had returned with everything but GOD. Nothing but GOD could have stopped their march at Paris. I suppose He didn’t care about Brussels or Antwerp. “Oh” she said “but that is only for a time”.</p>

		<p>Marchese de Rosale and his wife who was a Miss Bagg when Terry Fürholzen wrote to me about as an adventuress at the Bulgarian Court, came to dine and Sybil and Irene. It wasn’t very lively.</p>

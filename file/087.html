		<p>Friday, March 5, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Â </p>
		<p>  Took the Trenches down to dine with the boys, and also Miss Blazo. It was quite pleasant, but I caught a sort of cold or rheumatism in my neck and ear. Trench was nicer than I have seen him, talking about his 17 years work in the Education Office, where they have about 1200 men doing red-tape work, while he thinks 150 would be enough!!</p>

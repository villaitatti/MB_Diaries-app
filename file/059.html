		<p>Friday, February 5, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Day of work. Placci and the Gays came to dine. Placci has been for three weeks in Piedmont and Lombardy, and he was very much discouraged by the state of popular feeling there – no one even dreaming of joining the war.</p>
		<p>It is a perpetual question, up, down, shall we? should we? devoid of all dignity or moral importance. In the end I fear I will depend rather on Giolitti’s parliamentary juggling than on any respectable reason.</p>
		<p>Cecil came up in the car which took the Gays back. He has had a hard but most interesting time at Balsorano. The greatest discomfort he suffered was from a finger that one amateur Red Cross doctor seized upon and burned nearly to the bone with undiluted iodine, which he tied up on the finger!</p>
		<p>  BB tea at Sybil’s.</p>

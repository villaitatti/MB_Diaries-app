		<p>Tuesday, January 19, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Worked all morning, after seeing corset maker and lace mender. Cecil came to lunch and we gave him 500 francs for the Terremoto sufferers in the Abruzzo.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey and Cecil and I went to town in the car and did various errands, and then Geoffrey and I called on the Loesers (out) and on Yoï. Nello came in late, and when we were going Yoï kept back Geoffrey to whisper to him that she heard “from all sides” that we hadn’t liked her meeting him here and taking a long walk with him. She was evidently blaming him for our criticism of her–so silly. It all came from her babbling to Stan Krayl about the walk, only half truths revised with lies, and where Stan spoke to me of it, I said I thought it was wrong of Yoï to deceive Nello and try to keep poor Geoffrey on. I am for myself glad Yoï heard of it, but it upsets Geoffrey to have her furious with him. However, I believe it is good for him in the long run. </p>

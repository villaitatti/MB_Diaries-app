		<p>  Geoffrey and Cecil got off to Rome. Geoffrey didn’t want to go at the last, as he loves the quiet life here in the library all day. But I am sure it will do him good and deliver him from his preoccupations with Yoï, which it is so hard to shake off in this little circle of which she forms part. He will feel that after all the world, his world is too big to let her play such an overwhelming part in it.</p>
		<p>  B.B. as usual went to see Sybil. I walked halfway and came home through the woods–a glorious day.   The American Consul and his wife (Dumont) came to dine–very American and provincial, but well-meaning people, rather intelligent. They stayed too late.</p>

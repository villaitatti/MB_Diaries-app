		<p>Saturday, October 23, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Walked with BB and Geoffrey over the quarries. A most wonderful day and a delicious walk.</p>
		<p>The Hultons and Reggie Temple dined here. The latter, after going to see Herbert Horne every day for 4 years, and spending from 1-5 hours at each visit, suddenly stopped, about a year ago, and hasn’t been near him since. Pure caprice. I hope I persuaded him to go again, for Horne felt it very much. But of course he never lets anyone become friends with him.</p>

		<p>Wednesday, July 5, 1933, Abano</p>
		<p>Albergo Orologio</p>
		<p>Hot</p>
		<p>Motored across the Futa and had lunch up a little lane and R just beyond Doiano, under chestnuts.</p>
		<p>Saw exposition at Ferraia came here. Too tired to sleep. Countess Papafava’s son and daughter in law called in evening.</p>
		<p>Thursday, July 6, 1933, Abano</p>
		<p>Partly scirocco, partly fine.</p>
		<p>We motored to Chioggia, seeing things at Piove di Sacco on the way. An enchanting expedition – the Veneto is as distinct from Tuscany and even from Romagna, as if it were inhabited by a totally different race.</p>

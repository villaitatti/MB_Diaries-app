		<p>Wednesday, December 15, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Tramontana</p>
		<p>  A young American art student named Judson came to lunch, and earlier, to ask questions about Simone Martini. He was precise and self-possessed, but unattractive. I do loathe Americans almost as much as Germans at the present moment!</p>
		<p>  I called on Mrs. Ross and interviewed 4 cooks while BB took Sybil and her beloved Captain Peary a drive to the Madonna del Sasso.</p>
		<p>I had made the cooks each write out for me a week’s menu with I prezzi relativi. That will give me some idea of their repertoire and of their extravagance.</p>
		<p>  I got a dreadful “Hump” against Geoffrey. It has taken possession of me like a cross, morose and unfair “secondary personality”. </p>

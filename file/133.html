		<p>Tuesday, April 20, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  We went out for the day in 2 autos, B.B. Sybil and Iris in one, and I and the two boys in another. We went first to S. Martino Carnano (near Rignano) to see the Rosellino and Minos discovered by Giglioli–then to Montecarlo, where we had lunch in the woods; then to Croppino [sic.] (a fine Romanesque church on the slopes of Vallombrosa), and finally to Poggio (above Loro Ciuffena) where there was an old picture, not very important.</p>
		<p>It was a beautiful day and very enjoyable.</p>
		<p>We must do it often. </p>

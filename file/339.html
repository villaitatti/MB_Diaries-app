		<p>Friday, November 12, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Raining</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  The new cook came, and gave us a horrid lunch, but a worse dinner, meat eggs and fish all bad, potatoes uneatable. He won’t do, I fear. Alas–to begin again all that fuss.</p>
		<p>  I took Yoï and her baby over to see the Bassiano and theirs. Hers is absolutely hideous while the little Caetani–a great beauty.</p>
		<p>  Brought Lina up, after some shopping.</p>
		<p>Sybil took tea with BB. Placci and Prince Paul of Serbia came in for an instant. </p>

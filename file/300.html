		<p>Monday, October 4, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>  Called on the Loesers in the morning, who live like German pigs, in their bath wrappers all day. Saw their hideous little “Milda” playing in the back, longed for my “Barbar”.</p>
		<p>  Lunched with Lina at Viareggio and enjoyed her two darling children. I motored her home.</p>
		<p>It was delightful to arrive.</p>

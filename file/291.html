		<p>Saturday, September 25, 1915, Caprarola</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>  Lunched at Orvieto, and rain came on. We reached Caprarola for tea in a downpour.</p>
		<p>Mrs. Baldwin has lost her beauty, poor thing, but keeps the values of a frivolous adventuress. It is very painful–horrible.</p>
		<p>Yet she is extremely able and has not only restored this huge place admirably but has made over her village and is now doing a valuable war work. I admire her and yet abhor her. </p>

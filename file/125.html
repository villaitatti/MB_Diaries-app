		<p>Monday, April 12, 1915, Hotel d’Italia, Urbino</p>
		<p>Ray, Pippa, Geoffrey Scott</p>

		<p>Saw Ducal Palace and frescoes of Salimbeni, and there motored to Borgo Sansepolcro, through deep snow, where we lunched. Then came home by the lower slopes of Vallombrosa, a most lovely road through that curious humped-up country. The afternoon was perfect.</p>
		<p>  Found BB who had arrived from Siena last night. They seem to have been very happy. </p>

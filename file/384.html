		<p>Monday, December 27, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Naima Lofroth, Julia</p>
		<p>Warm and Sunny</p>
		<p>3 lunch 4 dinner. </p>
		<p>  BB took Sybil for a drive and I walked in the garden after Geoffrey went down to his snare. Julia lunched in town with Lina and Gordon. Nello and Yoï came with his Mother and sister. Yoï is nearly crazy with “family”, but I think she deserves it all–and more. Marcella went to see Geoffrey. </p>
		<p>I am well over 50, and I don’t yet know how to live in any sense, whether physically, as to my body, or materialistically as to the use of wealth, or socially, as to the kind and amount of companionship I want, or normally––to be anything at all!–or emotionally, as to what to care for and how much. </p>

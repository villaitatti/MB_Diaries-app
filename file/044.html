		<p>Thursday, January 21, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Day of heavenly do nothing.  I mean nothing involving others, but just the work I like to do in the Library, with no one to bother me. I love such days, though I love them more when Geoffrey’s sitting opposite to me, also at work.</p>
		<p>  This year, for the first time in my life, I feel peaceful and at leisure. Nothing hurries or bothers me. It comes from having good health and very fine people to see and make social arrangements for.</p>
		<p>If it weren’t for the War I should be happy. But that is such ghastly background that it is nearly intolerable.</p>

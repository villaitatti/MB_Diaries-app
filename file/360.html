		<p> Friday, December 3, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> Scirocco</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Struggled with accounts–too horrible. I can’t add twice alike.</p>
		<p>Went with Madame Lucien Henraux to see a little Villa at Scandicci to which she has taken a great fancy. It might be arranged comfortably, as it is overwhelmingly romantic.</p>
		<p>  BB arrived with Sybil and Iris, Irene, Temple and the boys at 5 Via delle Terme, to go to see the Italian “Grand Guignol“. </p>
		<p>Luckily they gave comedies chiefly. Splendid actors the Sainati couple, and all of them, really.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey had a fearful “thump” it is a second personality (a hateful one). This time brought on by an oncoming cold I think. He suffered dreadfully from it and tried to conceal it and get the better of it, poor boy.</p>

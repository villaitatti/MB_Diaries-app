		<p>Monday, March 1, 1915, I Tatti</p>

		<p>Rain again</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  No home letters—but better War news–the Dardanelles really attacked and troops landing in the Gallipoli peninsula. Russian making a stand and even advancing, “blockade” fizzling out, and the “Dacia” towed by the French into Brest.</p>
		<p>Walked with Bernhard halfway to la solita Sybil, and there called on Mrs. Ross and Miss Erichsen. Nello came to dine, but without Yoï, who is still sick. Oh but I envy her for Ray!</p>
		<p>Geoffrey tells me that Byba Giuliani, who observes very keenly, thinks Yoï is neither contented nor happy, and that the marriage cannot turn out well. Italians read these things quickly. I think Byba knows nothing of the facts, but she sees Yoï is false and feels her to be dissatisfied. </p>

		<p>Monday, January 18, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, new footman Domenico Pieri</p>
		<p>  Foot sore, so could not walk. Went to town with Geoffrey, and called for BB at Sybil’s at 6. He says she reminds him of a cicala, no body or insides but all voice. I have never known anybody [to] talk the way she does. I can hardly bear it, although I am inclined to like her. </p>
		<p>  Poor B.B. is not well. I feel really troubled and anxious about him. He doesn’t sleep well, and he can’t digest. Most of the time he feels awfully tired.</p>
		<p>  Yoï and Nello came to dine. Nello was charming. Yoï had a sneezing cold, and her manner was cooler and to me much more agreeable. The more intimate she feels the more she puts me in a false position by taking it for granted I “understand” and “sympathize with” all her foolishness.</p>

		<p>Sunday, March 7, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Vida Bispham</p>
		<p>Fine and then cloudy</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Took Miss Bispham [on] a motor ride, and then called on Sybil and the Strongs.</p>
		<p>It was a lovely day and we sat out after lunch, enjoying the sunshine. In the evening we went (but not B.B.) with the Loesers to the Folies Bergeres to see a French Music Hall actress called Mistinguett. It wasn’t very good, but on the other hand, we got home at 11:15, so no harm was done.</p>

		<p>Tuesday, November 30, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Very cold</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Miss Paterson and Mrs. Clapp (very charming) came to lunch. I called on Flora Priestley, who talked for an hour and a quarter uninterrupted about her own affairs–it was very painful–reminded me of machinery running down.</p>
		<p>  Called on Placci, here for 24 hours between Udine and Rome. He had a talk with Cadorna and other big wigs. He says he KNOWS that Italy is silently going to declare War on Germany! That Romania and Greece will follow suit, and probably Bulgaria! Wonderfully good news, if true: but I can’t believe it. I think Greece will go with Germany and Romania too. The Bassianos and Marainis came to dine. Geoffrey stayed away, and it was as well, for Yoï really looked very beautiful, in spite of signs of age. </p>

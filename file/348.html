		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p>Horrible Wind</p>

		<p>  Scattered morning. Putting away photos. Found the lost Pieros just where they ought to be! Must have been made positively blind by panic, Geoffrey too. Very strange!</p>
		<p>BB by no means “adequate”. Walked a little in garden in high mind.</p>
		<p>  Mr. Mrs. Dumont came bringing Mr. Flowroy, the expert in American passports. They said Volpi had gone to America with 4 million of goods to sell, and that his son-in-law, Ciampolini came in the awful state saying his young concubine had 2 confidants on board who meant with her aid to rob him. They wanted her prevented from entering, but mismanaged so that he too is held up, under a sort of White       Slave law, not allowed to enter!</p>

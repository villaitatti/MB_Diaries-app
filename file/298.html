		<p>Saturday, October 2, 1915, Villa Bice Marina di Pisa</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  We motored to Collodi in the morning, saw over it and the garden and had lunch in a delicious olive grove on the hills above Pescia. Saw Cecil off to Florence and then Geoffrey and I motored to Massa, got out our permits to stay in the Zona di Guerra and came on here to visit Mascha and her husband, Arthur Travers-Borgström. They seem very comfortable  and happy. He had a terrible drinking-fit for a month when they first came, and such D. T.s that 2 men could hardly control him, but since then he has been very nice. It is a madness, poor man, and he quite forgets what he does or says.</p>

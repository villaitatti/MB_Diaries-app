		<p>Trevy</p>
		<p>Flora Priestly to lunch, so deaf and so silly that it was tragic and the worst was she knew we felt it!</p>

		<p>Trevy</p>
		<p>Carlo Placci to lunch. I enjoyed him as much as one enjoys a meal when one has no appetite.</p>
		<p>Trevy read me some of his poems and we went us with Genji V (in through)</p>

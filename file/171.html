		<p>Naima, Morra<p>
		<p>Grey and raining<p>
		<p>Read the Siena chapter of B.B.’s Life to Morra and Naima and B.B.<p>

		<p>Fine<p>
		<p>I am so glad. For I started out to be his helpmate and it has been better for me to be laid aside for illness. It is a pure benediction that Nicky came take my place (and better!), but I have felt sometimes so worthless. But if I am doing what he thinks worthwhile, then it is well.<p>
		<p>Giglioli “irrigated” me with anti-streptococcus vaccine and I fell into a high fever. 40º.<p>
		<p>Mr. and Mrs. Janey and Placci and Paul called.<p>

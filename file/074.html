		<p>Saturday, February 20, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott, Naomi R.</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Byba came and walked with Geoffrey. I had a headache, but got over it and went [for] a delightful walk by myself in the woods.</p>
		<p>Cecil had been dining with Sybil, who pumped into him a feeling that he must enlist. She feels it herself so fervently that she is contagious. So Cecil came and told me he meant to, the more so as his brother has gone to the front after only 2 month’s drill. I argued and argued (inutile de repéter) and then Geoffrey talked with him half the night. All Cecil put forward was that “people” were criticizing him for not going, and these “people” were Sybil and Edmund Houghton. He told Naima he didn’t want to go.</p>
		<p>I was very agitated and miserable on it all, and I must confess cross with Sybil. </p>

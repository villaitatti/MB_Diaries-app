		<p>Monday, March 27, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Grey and cold</p>
		<p>Desmond</p>
		<p>Logan, Desmond and Nicky lunched with Iris and Jimmy Flexner lunched here. He makes, on the whole, a poor impression on us. Anthony brought Mme Cabot to tea, and Lador Flavia Farina and her daughter son in law. Mr. and Mrs Dazzi came. I get very tired. In the evening Desmond read us Yeats and Belle and himself.</p>

		<p>Naima and a little ___</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky went to Roem to stay with the Khuens.</p>
		<p>Mrs. Hungtington Jackson came to tea, and some excruciatingly insignificant Americans, Mr. and Mrs. Dunlops.</p>
		<p>Logan and Desmond called in Strong. Desmond dined with Byba Coster and went to the Lotte Lehmann concert.</p>

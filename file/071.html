		<p>Wednesday, February 17, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Margaret Strong brought Miss Vida Bispham (daughter of my old friend David, the singer) to lunch. We all liked her.</p>
		<p>It was a lovely day and we sat in the stanzone. BB had a drive with Sybil and Geoffrey dined with her. Geoffrey and I had a beautiful walk over to Fiesole (under Castel di Poggio) but it was dark when I came back and the road was so stony I got tired.</p>
		<p>Old age shows in the circulation in my hip, which are at times quite painful. Coraggio!</p>
		<p>  Cecil got here from Balzorano [sic.] entirely disgusted with the muddle and confusion. He thinks nothing useful will be done. </p>

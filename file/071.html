		<p>Little Gianni Origo died this morning. Poor Iris!<p>
		<p>We had Placci and Mrs. Cooper Hewitt to lunch. Their talk was awful, his backstains gossip, his boasting about Italic efficiency. Mrs. Shapley and her 2 daughters came to tea and I took them to see the Casa Boccaccio. Mr. and Mrs. Biondi and Pellegrina came, Lina and Aubrey, Olga and LÃ©ner dined here and Sessions came in to tell us about the horrid happening with Barbara.<p>

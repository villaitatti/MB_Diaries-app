		<p>  Placci and Edmund Houghton came to lunch. Pl.[acci] is afraid the terrible earthquake of Avezzano and the Abruzzi may put off or hinder the War. He says Giolitti means to try to snatch the power from Salandra, where the House reassembles, and for that if he can find a good Casus Belli, Salandra may declare war first. Von Bülow is constantly seeing Giolitti, who would come in with a Neutral Policy. But Pl.[acci] says he would change it to War fast enough once he was in the seat. What miserable business it is–determining such things by such motives!</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey telephoned and wished he were here to walk with us to the Tree. He seemed to feel there was no point in doing anything by himself. Those boys live in far too restricted a circle. I do deplore it. But Florence is a desert for our sort of people.</p>

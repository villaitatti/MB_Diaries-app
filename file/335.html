		<p>  Accounts–how complicated! But I shall manage these. Sybil came and walked with BB and I went to Dr. Banti about my heart. He says it’s only uric acid–the old foe–and not functional, so I needn’t bother. It has been such a queer sensation hearing and feeling it always pumping away. However now I shan’t bother. I brought Lina up from town. She sent over to Geoffrey her first chapter of “Sicily”, a regular outpouring à la Symond-cum-Hutton, but not badly done for that. </p>

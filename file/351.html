		<p>Wednesday, November 24, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  What a heavenly day. We planned things in the garden. Then the boys and I went to Villa Beccari to buy bees, but all the people have gone to fight. Geoffrey and I called on Mascha, who is just leaving for Lucerne. She said the Loesers most trusted servant had been caught and confessed to having stolen from them every day. His room was full of pilfered things, but, worse still, undelivered letters. Someone stole Mrs. Loeser’s passport and money–probably an ex-servant as a vendetta–and this led to all the rooms being searched and this man discovered.</p>
		<p>  I sympathize with him. I hear on all sides that my beloved Aristea was a filthy traitoress or disloyal wretch.</p>

		<p>Sunday, February 28, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>Fine, sat out after lunch</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Margaret and her father and Miss Guiliani came to lunch. Cecil and I walked with the Strongs part way back, and Geoffrey had a very long walk with Byba, whom he much likes. But she agitated him talking a lot about Yoï. Cecil and I had a walk. BB called on Mrs. Ross. Sunday is his “day off” from Sybil.</p>
		<p>  A most beautiful day. But I was sad because Ray’s hopes for and another baby have come to nothing. I sent her £10 as a consolation present, poor child. She is awfully disappointed. </p>

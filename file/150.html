		<p>Friday, May 7, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Worked on BB’s Bellini in the morning. Took Yoï and Nello and Stan to see Montefiano, where Yoï wants to go for the summer. Brought them back for tea. Stan is still immersed in her relations with Gordon Craig, who is frightfully unreasonable and jealous.</p>
		<p>  Sybil, Madame Luchaire and Salvemini came to dinner. Salvemini has lost all his youthful illusions of being able to convince “the people” of anything reasonable. The power of the press is too great for cultivated and disinterested and reasonable ideas to gain ground. </p>

		<p>Monday, October 25, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Began to get the villino in order. BB motored with Sybil, and Geoffrey and I walked, and I called on Mrs. Ross. Geoffrey very down with liver attack.</p>
		<p>  Salvemini and Madame Luchaire came to dine, his last evening before going North. The horror of it gripped and held us so that we could scarcely find anything to say. That a brilliant upright useful man like that–the nicest Italian we have ever known–should throw his life away for the Trentino or Trieste is fantastic–and tragic. I wept after he had gone. Salvemini was very distressed at Italy’s taking no actions in the Balkans. Altogether he feels something “poco chiaro” in her present policy.</p>

		<p>Wednesday, November 17, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott </p>
		<p>Beautiful</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Dreadful day for BB. Could not find 2 photos he wanted in the portfolios I brought him, and he became like a madman with rage–said he would leave the house and never return–and all sorts of things.</p>
		<p>  There was only one place where they could be, the place where we put all the as yet undistributed photos, but Geoffrey and I were so paralyzed and upset by his rage that we could not find the Piero della Francesca photo. By lunch he had calmed down a little, and in the afternoon we had a pleasant walk. But I was most awfully upset and couldn’t sleep. </p>

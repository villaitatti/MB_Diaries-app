		<p>Rain Scirocco</p>

		<p>  I had my first “letter” from little Barbara today, a scrawl in coloured pencils representing, apparently, “Grandma with sticks.”</p>
		<p>Alys had to suggest the eyes and the arms–children’s imaginations are either so indefinite or so lively that they are contented with the barest indications.</p>
		<p>It has been poured [sic] all day, but I walked with BB through the Laghetto on his faithful road to tea at Sybil’s and then roamed by myself in the enclosure. I like walking alone best of all. It is the only way to really get in contact with nature.</p>
		<p>  Read a Japanese soldier’s book on the taking of Port Arthur. The horror of it kept me awake all night. But the little soldier loved it, horror and all, as a Xn [Christian] martyr might love his martyrdom. </p>

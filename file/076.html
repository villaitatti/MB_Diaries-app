		<p>  A “submerged Personality” took possession of me, and I raged and said things that I should never had said had I been “myself”. It was a very strange experience, and as I was self-conscious through it all, it has taught me a lot. But it really did get hold of me. It kept me awake at night simply furious and disgusted. B.B. was quite frightened and became as meek as a lamb. It all started with my finding him kissing Naomi and feeling disgust: which was silly, as I know it is the only thing one can do with that wild goat of a young female. This, however, brought up all my “grievances”, from Belle Greene to Sybil, and I said the nastiest and most devilish things about them all and about BB. The worst of it was, I enjoyed it! Fortunately I retained enough secure to tear up my sub-acid letter to Sybil about Cecil.</p>

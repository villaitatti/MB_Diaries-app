		<p>  Mr. Benn and Cecil came to lunch. Cecil’s municipal plan for the new town near Balsorano has been accepted by the “Genio Militare” and he is to go down to Rome to present it to them complete. It is I fear a barren honour as far as cash goes, but it shows that his work is recognized as good.</p>
		<p>I had a heavenly day of quiet work and reading (newspapers alas), except that everything has a bitter taste while the War lasts. BB went to Sybil’s as usual, and then called on Aunt Janet. When he came back we had one of our weekly rows over the change I wanted to introduce into the Ms. of his article on “Venetian Pictures in the United States” for the magazine “Art in America”, but we made it up, and he accepted most of my suggestions. As we were quarrelling I saw how tired his eyes looked, and felt awfully sorry for him.</p>

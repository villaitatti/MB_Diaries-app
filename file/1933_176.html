		<p>Morra, Edith</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p>Feeling very slack. Mr. Davis came to lunch- he is an astrologer!!</p>
		<p>Drove out, but it tired me dreadfully.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, November 22, 1933, I Tatti</p>

		<p>The others all went to Siena and then to the Sanminiatellis ending up with tea at Uzzano.</p>

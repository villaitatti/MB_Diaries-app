		<p>Beautiful Morra<p>
		<p>A day of much discomfort for me, and B.B. and Nicky feel “let down” with the change of the heights. I read The House of Exile by Nora Waln. Too tired to work, alas. Awful night.<p>

		<p>Morra left at 11. Perhaps a little better. Read “Lawrence and Brett” and Shakespeare’s Henry IV, pt. 1. I try to seem cheerful.<p>

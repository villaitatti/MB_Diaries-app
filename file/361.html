		<p>Saturday, December 4, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Rain, Dull</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey went to bed with a bad cold. Nello came to lunch. BB took Sybil motoring and walked from the Madonna del Sasso.</p>
		<p>  Mrs. Ross, the Bates-Batchellers and Reggie Temple came to dine, Mrs. Ross bringing the book of pictures and autographs of celebrated people she had known–most interesting. Mrs. Batcheller has such a passion for the Great, that she was really interested in it. She sang ballads to us and the “The Last Rose of Summer”–a surprising but not sympathetic voice, very high, and an unmusical unspontaneous manner of singing. But it was a pleasant evening.</p>
		<p>  Sent 40 to pay for Julia’s school, from BB. </p>

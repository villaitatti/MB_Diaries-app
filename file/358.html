		<p>  BB received a most unexpected cheque from Wildenstein for 50,000 (francs)! He had written it off as a bad debt.</p>
		<p>  Cecil came to lunch. They have put one great Buddha into a most beautiful wooden niche in the new library. Boxes are being planted today in the new garden.</p>
		<p>  I took BB to Sybil’s and then did some errands in town, including buying a sewing machine, and then called for Sybil. Prince Paul was there, playing with Irene, and seeming very much a boy.</p>

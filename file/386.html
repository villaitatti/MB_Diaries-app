		<p>Wednesday, December 29, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p>4 lunch 8 dinner</p>
		<p> Miss Che-mi-fa Michela came to lunch, and was very brilliant. She is one of those who perform their shining and notes not with pining all the fever of some differing soul. BB thinks Geoffrey will come to an end of her fairly soon, but I see him sinking fracturally into the sex bog. By now he is up to the knees. However, she is independent and original and interesting, a real personality. He stayed on to dinner in spite of Yoï’s coming, and I think Nello had a horrid evening. Mrs. Ross and Lina came too. Yoï looked pretty, but he found her silly, and she had no longer the old power over him. Meno male. </p>

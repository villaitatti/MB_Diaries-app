		<p>Wednesday, September 29, 1915, Grand Hotel Siena</p>
		<p> Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott </p>
		<p>  Motored from Caprarola. Had lunch by Lake of Bolsena. Saw Monteoliveto.</p>
		<p>Found letter from Inez Boisservaire, who has been sent home by the Italian Government. She richly deserved it!</p>
		<p>“I’m not pro-German–” she wrote, “not in the least–nothing would grieve me more than a German victory–except a victory for the Allies. I am against war–all war–that is all. And if this war ends with a victory gained by military strength, we shall have militarism rampant in the world for a long time to come. I want an intelligent adjudication and I want it soon. And I don’t go on the theory that any parties to the certified are more to blame than the others. I am not interested in placing blame. I am interested in avoiding such stupidities for the future.”</p>
		<p>The Italian government evidently was interested in avoiding such stupidities for the present.</p>

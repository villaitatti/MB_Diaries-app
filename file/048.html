		<p>  A most interesting letter from Geoffrey describing the “confusione” that reigns in the Relief work in the Abruzzo.  They spent the night at Balsorano (Friday). The only person who was of any use was Salvemini, and he has the Socialist maggot in his head which makes him believe that the people can be made to live in a quite new well drained town, deserting their old unsanitary and now destroyed haunts. But the human animal is unlike that. I fear.</p>
		<p>  I began an article for Guido’s “Rassegna d’Arte” on the Italian pictures in Cracow–a rather silly proceeding, full of padding.</p>
		<p>  Yoï and Nello to dine. Rather flat. I called on Sybil with B.B., walking up and back. Wonderful misty effects, between Turner and Guardi.</p>

		<p>Friday, February 19, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Sybil called and BB went back to tea with her.</p>
		<p>Cecil came in and said he thought he would have to go to the War after all. His brother has been sent to the Front after only 2 month’s drill.</p>
		<p>It will be an awful calamity for us.</p>
		<p>I do not believe he will ever come back, he is not strong enough to survive it. It is heartbreaking. I am so fond of him.</p>
		<p>  Geoffrey and I had a gloomy walk, especially as, at lunch, BB was in such a rage with Cecil he wouldn’t hear of any Terms we might make about at least finishing the Library.</p>
		<p>Geoffrey was upheld, though, by having had a really charming letter from “Nicky Mariano” who is in Russia. He is ½ in love with her already. Well, I have Barbara, and envy no one!</p>

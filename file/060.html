		<p>Saturday, February 6, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Naima, Cecil Pinsent, Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  I was going to town, but sent Miss Erichsen instead, as I felt too ill. She called on Yoï and brought Naima up.</p>
		<p>  Margaret Strong and Romola Trench came to dine, looking very sweet and young. Romola is a real beauty, but Margaret is, I think, nicer. Cecil was helpful and agreeable, but BB and Geoffrey buried their noses in a book of Chinese characters and paid no attention to the company. </p>

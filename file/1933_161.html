		<p>Morra<p>
		<p>Fine<p>
		<p>Alas, another little bout of fever. Very discouraging – one me downhearted. Ojetti and Giuliana Benzoni came to lunch. De Filippi and Signora Nathan to tea. I was in bed. But I got up and went to library after dinner.<p>

		<p>Better, but did not come to lunch. Nesta and the Levys, Mr. Ellis to walk with B.B. and Miss McLaren. Miss Spencer Smith, Mr. Burke and Miss Locker-Lampsen to see the picture and have tea. A call from Ralph announces Rachel’s peaceful death.<p>

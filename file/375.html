		<p>Saturday, December 18, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Warm, Dampish</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent, Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Continued the talk throughout the day.</p>
		<p>We read BB’s manuscript. I feel as if it were those old old days when I used to get so wild with his lumbering careless elephantine style. I nearly weep sometimes in sheer despair that a person can be so bungling and clumsy in expression. It gets into one’s mind so it is awfully hard to rewrite in a crisper cleaner way–he has a Madonna “rising from the hips and emitting a radiance from her head”–</p>
		<p>BB and I had a walk from the grove down. It was very beautiful and I enjoyed it very much.</p>

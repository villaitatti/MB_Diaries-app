		<p>  Hump going, but I feel very ill. Miss Marcella Michela came to lunch, a brilliant, beautiful, clean-cut girl, with real talent for description. She was very amusing about D'Annunzio.</p>
		<p>BB had tea with Sybil, who is in bed, and Geoffrey, Marcella had a long walk, from 3:30-7:15. I got the hump again, at the sort of casual way, coming in and ordering tea at 7 and being so smisurati–but it goes with Youth, and I’m fearfully glad for Geoffrey to have a good time. The truth is, I got anxious about them, as it was so dark and I thought she might have slipped and turned her ankle. I received a call from Mr. and Mrs. Batcheller and Miss Cochrane, whom we last saw at Mrs. Charles T. Fields’ in Boston.</p>
		<p>  Long talk with Geoffrey about Marcella. All my “Hump” vanished.</p>

		<p>Thursday, December 16, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>

		<p>  My “Hump” still persists, and I feel disgusted with everybody–myself most of all. Yet there is a certain bitter pleasure in ruminating my grievances.</p>
		<p>  Cecil came up to inspect the falling bridge and the unsafe wall of our house on the stream–both due to the remissness of the Comune in accepting our offer to pay ½ expenses of a necessary dam. BB lost his temper over it, and said he wouldn’t do a thing, he wanted his house to fall down, etc. etc. and damn the Comune instead of the stream.</p>
		<p>It took Cecil ½ hour to bring him to reason. I do hate to see him make such a silly spectacle of himself.</p>
		<p>  Prince Paul, who has been ill, came to tea, and Geoffrey and me went the evening trying to make up, while BB dined with Sybil. Of course a hump, being unreasonable, is not dispersed by argument. However. I’m so fond of him, it can’t last.</p>

		<p>  BB and I walked on a new road leading to the Madonna del Sasso. Too beautiful, I left him at Sybil’s and picked up the boys and went to the Dumont’s “Thanksgiving” reception. Mr. Gregory Swift promised me some more gourd-seeds. Dumont said that he warned the Prefetto and Volpi’s other friends that if they did not give him the letter they promised on Sunday by 4 on Wednesday he would call to the NY authorities that Volpi was not a character to allow into the US.  This he did: to their surprise and rage when they turned up with the letter on Thursday morning!!  This is so characteristically Italian that I can’t imagine how they ever carry on any concerted warlike operations.</p>

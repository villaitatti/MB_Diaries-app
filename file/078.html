		<p>  Mr. Benn came to lunch, and we went in the afternoon to see Yoï and Nello and the Loesers. Loeser was going on about having “outgrown architects” and the superiority of a simple building, a box, not a house. He has in fact put up one, which comes very close to looking like a tenement house! They have a really darling little girl, a year and 8 months old–so intelligent.</p>
		<p>Yoï is very seasick and miserable already dreads her confinement next next [sic] October. Olga, who was sick for 9 months, day and night, says nothing will ever induce her to have another baby.</p>
		<p>BB dined with Sybil. </p>

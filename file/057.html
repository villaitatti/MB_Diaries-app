		<p>Wednesday, February 3, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Fine, cold</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>In bed with cold.</p>
		<p>  Giglioli came and said Cecil was the most valuable of all the workers in the Earthquake Zone.</p>
		<p>Lady Enniskillen and Mr. Benn came to lunch, but I didn’t get up.</p>
		<p>I did get up to arrive and receive the Dumonts (Consul) and a young friend of theirs, Miss Blazo of Providence. They stayed very late. Geoffrey showed the pictures to the young lady, who “adored” them all, all for the wrong reasons.</p>
		<p>  BB afternoon at Sybil’s.</p>

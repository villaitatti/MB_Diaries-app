		<p>Sunday, April 23, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Logan, Naima, Ivins</p>
		<p>Very cold.</p>
		<p>Ivins arrived for tea – she seemed just the same as 8 years ago. Chatter about horns and prints in evening. Am reading Maurice Morgann’s Falstaff.</p>
		<p>Monday, April 24, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Glorious day</p>
		<p>The Gravina came to lunch. Alas, she is losing her memory. Maria Teresa Rasponi came for tea bringing her sister-in-law, Donna Elena Corsini, very charming young woman. Lucy Hewitt also came to tea and Mr. and Mrs. Maurice Clark and 2 boys with Miss Wald.</p>

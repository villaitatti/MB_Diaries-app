		<p>Scirocco</p>
		<p>A very quiet but pleasant day, resting.</p>
		<p>Our car is worn out. Parry has to go to Florence and pick out the next one.</p>
		<p>Wednesday, July 12, 1933, Gazzada</p>
		<p>Scirocco</p>
		<p>B.B. and Nicky went to Milan to see things. I got on with my “Life of B.B.”</p>
		<p>Lucy Porter telegraphed that Kingsley was drowned on the 8th. We are overwhelmed; we loved him. He was B.B.’s dearest colleague. Poor Lucy!</p>

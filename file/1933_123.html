		<p>Wednesday, August 9, 1933, Consuma<p>
		<p>Clotilde, Alys<p>
		<p>Very hot but lovely. Hortense came to tea with Sophie, who has dyed her hair yellow and looks crass. She wants to have another baby and says frankly it is for the sensual joy of suckling it. Hortense said that the whole affair from the beginning and seemed to her disgusting. Alys arrived<p>
		<p>Thursday, August 10, 1933, Consuma<p>
		<p>Hotter still.<p>
		<p>Morra came to lunch bringing his friend C[hiaramonte] who is writing on Michelangelo. He left after tea, but Morra is staying. Alys and I had a little walk in the woods. Perhaps too long for I had a return of pain in the night. What a bore!<p>

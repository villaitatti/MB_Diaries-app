		<p>Saturday, November 6, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Began to grapple with accounts. I am about as unsuited for this as a rabbit for driving a motor-car!</p>
		<p>Walked with BB on the Careggi hill, called on the Bassianos, and on Mascha to say goodbye. Her husband has taken to drinking once more.</p>
		<p>  Vida Bispham and her husband Riccardo Daddi came to dine. He is a nice young fellow, serious and good, but delicate and with a harsh voice. She is certainly very boring. They’re horribly poor–£200 (francs) a month.</p>
		<p>  BB said that Sybil had begun to bore him dreadfully, as does nothing but talk of her officers and her entertainment. I am not surprised, for she has always struck me as a peculiarly insistent bore. </p>

		<p>Trevy, Morra</p>
		<p>In bed with this horrid swollen gland in my groin</p>

		<p>Sunday, January 22, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Trevy, Morra</p>
		<p>Cold wind</p>
		<p>In bed. Can’t move: it is so painful. But it is so pleasant here with a crackling wood fire, lots of flowers (daffodils, violets, freejias, forsythia, roses, orchids, almond blossom), books, a nice view.</p>

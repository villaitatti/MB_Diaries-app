		<p>B.B. and Nicky went back to the Ferana Exposition, where they were joined by Pellegrina and Countess Papafava. I drove to Padua with Byba to meet Harry Coster (her husband) and saw Santa Giustina.</p>

		<p>A review of my book (Newcastle Evening Chronicle) says – “You get back to the very kernel of Christianity in Mrs. Berenson’s book which describes her journey from Syria to Baalbec.”</p>
		<p>On Saturday afternoon we went with Byba and Harry to Este.</p>

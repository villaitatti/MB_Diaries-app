		<p> Irene Law and Placci came to lunch, and we walked with him from the Madonna del Sasso down to S. Brigida. He had no news, but said we must “trust” that Italy was going to do the right thing in the Balkans. Considering that she is in fact nothing but a Balkanic state herself, how are we to have confidence?</p>
		<p>  The boys dined with Sybil and Irene.</p>

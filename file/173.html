		<p>Sunday, May 30, 1915, Hotel d’Italie, Aquila</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Saw Aquila + motored to Assergi. Not a very interesting trip with clouds hung over the Gran Sasso. Church full of strange images, very polytheistic. People suspicious. Well they may be at sightseers now!</p>
		<p>Monday, May 31, 1915, Castello Ari Prov. di Chieti</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>BB nearly lynched by mob for looking at Church through opera-glasses. This was yesterday. Today we had a guard to accompany us, and when we departed after an early lunch the people gathered and cheered us!</p>
		<p>  Stopped at Capistrano and motored to Popoli to get our papers in order. Tea at San Clemente in Casavera and pushed on to Chieti and then here, where we found an English country house, and BB’s old acquaintance, Carnegy Johnson, established as permanent pensionnaire. </p>

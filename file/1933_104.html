		<p>Monday, July 3, 1933, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Prentice Duell</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p>Tea: Mr. Duell came to stay; the Shapleys and I took the little girls to the stream to build a dam. Talked about Egypt and Etrusca evening. Duell lives at Memphis, and “also digs at Tarquinia.”</p>

		<p>Duell</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p>Lunch. The Doro Levis, Fraulein Wogan, Herr Hundzinger – it went off well. The Serrisotri came in the afternoon and Placci to dine but nice talk after he went. Poor Duell has a half crazy wife.</p>

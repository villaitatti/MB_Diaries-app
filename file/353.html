		<p>Friday, November 26, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Naima Lofroth</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  BB and I had a splendid walk in the valley behind Castel del Poggio. Such a day!</p>
		<p>The boys and Naima and I went to the Theatre to see a rather dull play by Goldoni (Zago Company) Le smanie per la villeg[g]iatura” but I enjoyed it as being so different from the war! It was an incredible relief to get back into that kind of world–the more frivolous, the better.</p>
		<p>I lunched with Naima, to taste the skill of the new cook, Margarita, whom I am engaging. She seems very good.</p>
		<p>Aristea does really seem to have been a complete fraud and wretch–liar, prostitute, cheat, braggart, plotter and everything else. I was deceived!</p>

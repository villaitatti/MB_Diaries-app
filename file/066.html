		<p>Friday, February 12, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Rain</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Cecil went off to Rome and Balzorano [sic.].</p>
		<p>  Walked with BB to Villa Medici and called on the Herberts (out) the Strongs, and Sybil. Came home with him in car. We discussed Miss Giuliani as a wife for Geoffrey, and decided it might just do, as she has plenty of money. She looks, BB said, like a “Levantine monkey” and she is very tiny, but I think she is a really good sort. She seems to be making a dead set at our young friend. He says there is no danger. </p>

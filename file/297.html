		<p>  We saw today 6 interesting XVIII century villas: 1) Mansi, with street of water surrounded by parapet and statues and a fountain-grotto with Diana and Actaeon.  </p>
		<p>2) Villa Torrigiani, with glorious cypress avenue, and charming sunk garden, and diverting jeux d’eaux to wet the runway. 3) Villa dei Vescovi, the most liveable-in of all, a lovely situation, and fine baroque entrance to wood 4) Villa della Principessa, inhabited by a mad Bourbon prince, Principe di Capua, who for 40 years hasn’t spoken to anyone, and gets in a rage of anyone goes near him. He sits all day from 6 till sunset on his front step, and throws away all his plates and cups. We saw him throwing away his tea things–made of enamel or horn, of course–a bent old figure with white hair. The place is magnificent and has a green theatre and glorious water-garden. 5) Villa Rossellini with fine loggia and 6) Villa Bernardini, with large ilex groves and a lovely water garden. Such an enchanting day. </p>

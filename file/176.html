		<p>Wednesday, June 2, 1915, Albergo Pace, Scanno</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>Sybil’s motor skidded and BB’s head was wounded, but not seriously. Axle cracked, so we came on slowly to Sulmona***.</p>
		<p>  Drive from Guardiagrele to Pescocostanzo absolutely divine along the Maiella–***</p>
		<p>  Sulmona crowded with officers so we came up here to sleep. </p>

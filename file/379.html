		<p>Wednesday, December 22, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Julia</p>
		<p>Fine</p>
		<p>  Julia arrived at 8.30, and we went shopping after lunch. She is a dear intelligent child. Called at Sybil’s while Julia saw Iris. I went sound asleep while Sybil was telling me about her hospital committee, but I think she did not notice it. </p>
		<p>  The Dumonts, Cecil, Mrs. Ross and Lina dined here. Mrs. Dumont opened her heart (?) a little and disclosed a strange (?) sex complex there. </p>

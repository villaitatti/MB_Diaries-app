		<p>Sunday, December 12, 1915, I Tatti</p>
		<p>Scirocco</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Florence Baldwin</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Felt rather ill, but as no one else would, I took Florence Baldwin out and we visited the grave of her daughter Audrey and then the Gamberaia, deserted of its inhabitants who for 15 months have been running a soldier’s hospital at Biarritz.</p>
		<p>When I came home I was about worn out with her silly and extraordinary talk, and made Geoffrey take her to the music room. He was consternated for he too is fed up with her.</p>
		<p>She is extraordinarily like Yoï, but grown old and without any man’s protection. She called herself a “battered butterfly”.</p>

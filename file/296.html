		<p>Thursday, September 30, 1915, Albergo Universo Lucca</p>
		<p>Geoffrey Scott, Cecil Pinsent</p>
		<p> </p>
		<p>  Left Siena at 10 and lunched under Volterra, having seen the Villa Celsa first–charming connecting gallery, chapel and gardens by Peruzzi.</p>
		<p>  Saw Laré and inspected the Bagni di Casciano–nel caso mai.</p>
		<p>Reached here in time to see the most glorified sunset there ever was from the city wall.</p>
		<p>  BB writes “Sybil amuses me a bit and annoys me more by the indirection wherewith she goes back as every plan we make directly her hotel-keeping preoccupations demand it. Today another lot of ‘officers’ arrive and their indirection will take up most of her energies for the rest of my stay….The fact is, I wish you were back. I am not much of a visitor, except for 2 or 3 days at a time.</p>
		<p>  HENRI was killed on the French front.</p>
